Extract of the questions from @gebru2021datasheets.


**Motivation**

1. *For what purpose was the dataset created? Was there a specific task in mind? Was there a specific gap that needed to be filled? Please provide a description.*

The dataset was created to investigate the cybersecurity incidents impacting various organizations, considering their size and sector. It helps to understand the importance of cybersecurity and the need for a strong defense against such threats.


2. *Who created the dataset (for example, which team, research group) and on behalf of which entity (for example, company, institution, organization)?*

The dataset was compiled by Tsen, Elinor, Ko, Ryan, and Slapnicar, Sergeja, affiliated with The University of Queensland. 


3. *Who funded the creation of the dataset? If there is an associated grant, please provide the name of the grantor and the grant name and number.*

The dataset compilation was part of a PhD project, presumably supported by funding allocated for academic research by The University of Queensland. No specific grant number is associated with the dataset creation, as per the available information. 

4. *Any other comments?*

The dataset is a resource for researchers, policymakers, and cybersecurity professionals to study cyber resilience in today's digital world.

**Composition**

1. *What do the instances that comprise the dataset represent (for example, documents, photos, people, countries)? Are there multiple types of instances (for example, movies, users, and ratings; people and interactions between them; nodes and edges)? Please provide a description.*

The instances within the dataset represent cybersecurity incidents, especially data breaches and ransomware attacks on various organizations. Each instance shows details such as the nature of the attack, the sector and size of the organization affected, the geographical location, and the impact and response measures. 

2. *How many instances are there in total (of each type, if appropriate)?*

The exact number of cyberattack instances are 1146 of each type withing 15 years of time frame from 2004 to 2020.
	
3. *Does the dataset contain all possible instances or is it a sample (not necessarily random) of instances from a larger set? If the dataset is a sample, then what is the larger set? Is the sample representative of the larger set (for example, geographic coverage)? If so, please describe how this representativeness was validated/verified. If it is not representative of the larger set, please describe why not (for example, to cover a more diverse range of instances, because instances were withheld or unavailable).*

The dataset does not cover all possible instances but represents a broad selection from multiple resources. It is a sample of large number of cyber incidents, focusing on publicly reported and confirmed attacks. It includes a diverse range of incidents from various sectors and countries to provide a representative overview of cyber threats.
	
4. *What data does each instance consist of? "Raw" data (for example, unprocessed text or images) or features? In either case, please provide a description.*

Each instance includes processed data with features such as the year of the attack, the name of the organization, critical industry classification, organization size, level of digital intensity, the sector, country, details of the cyber security role and frameworks, impact level, and actions taken. This provides a structured understanding of each incident.

5. *Is there a label or target associated with each instance? If so, please provide a description.*

Each instance is labeled with the type of attack (e.g., ransomware, data breach) and classified by its impact level (e.g., low, medium, high) based on the response taken by the organization.
	 
6. *Is any information missing from individual instances? If so, please provide a description, explaining why this information is missing (for example, because it was unavailable). This does not include intentionally removed information, but might include, for example, redacted text.*

There is many missing information in the dataset.This might be due to provacy concerns, or some orgnizations did not report the exact information. For example, instances such as number of users affected has lot of gaps in the dataset.
	
7. *Are relationships between individual instances made explicit (for example, users' movie ratings, social network links)? If so, please describe how these relationships are made explicit.*

The datasets do not explicitly mention relationships between individual instances, however they can be drawn while doing statistical analysis.

8. *Are there recommended data splits (for example, training, development/validation, testing)? If so, please provide a description of these splits, explaining the rationale behind them.*

There are no specific recommended data splits mentioned. Data splits would depend on the specific research or analysis goals.

9. *Are there any errors, sources of noise, or redundancies in the dataset? If so, please provide a description.*

Specific errors or sources of noise are not mentioned. However, as with any databreach report data, there may be variabilities and inconsistencies due to natural fluctuations and measurement limitations.

10. *Is the dataset self-contained, or does it link to or otherwise rely on external resources (for example, websites, tweets, other datasets)? If it links to or relies on external resources, a) are there guarantees that they will exist, and remain constant, over time; b) are there official archival versions of the complete dataset (that is, including the external resources as they existed at the time the dataset was created); c) are there any restrictions (for example, licenses, fees) associated with any of the external resources that might apply to a dataset consumer? Please provide descriptions of all external resources and any restrictions associated with them, as well as links or other access points, as appropriate.*

The datasets are self-contained and available through the website of University of Queensland. 
 
11. *Does the dataset contain data that might be considered confidential (for example, data that is protected by legal privilege or by doctor-patient confidentiality, data that includes the content of individuals' non-public communications)? If so, please provide a description.*

No confidential or personally identifiable information is included in the dataset.
	
12. *Does the dataset contain data that, if viewed directly, might be offensive, insulting, threatening, or might otherwise cause anxiety? If so, please describe why.*

There is no content in these datasets that would be considered offensive or insulting. The data is factual, focusing on data breaches and cyber incidents.
	
13. *Does the dataset identify any sub-populations (for example, by age, gender)? If so, please describe how these subpopulations are identified and provide a description of their respective distributions within the dataset.*

The datasets do not specify sub-populations like age or gender.

14. *Is it possible to identify individuals (that is, one or more natural persons), either directly or indirectly (that is, in combination with other data) from the dataset? If so, please describe how.*

Individual identification is not possible with these datasets as they deal with aggregated data covering various countries.
	
15. *Does the dataset contain data that might be considered sensitive in any way (for example, data that reveals race or ethnic origins, sexual orientations, religious beliefs, political opinions or union memberships, or locations; financial or health data; biometric or genetic data; forms of government identification, such as social security numbers; criminal history)? If so, please provide a description.*

The datasets do not contain sensitive personal data. 
	
16. *Any other comments?*
	N/A

**Collection process**

1. *How was the data associated with each instance acquired? Was the data directly observable (for example, raw text, movie ratings), reported by subjects (for example, survey responses), or indirectly inferred/derived from other data (for example, part-of-speech tags, model-based guesses for age or language)? If the data was reported by subjects or indirectly inferred/derived from other data, was the data validated/verified? If so, please describe how.*

The data were directly observed and collected through various resources such as : Carnegie Mellonâ€™s List of Banking Cyber Incidents (2020), Repository of Industrial Security Incidents (2015), Privacy Rights ClearingHouse (2020) and Information is Beautiful (2020).
